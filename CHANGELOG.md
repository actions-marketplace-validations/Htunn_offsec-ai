## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added — AI/LLM Attack Expansion (Track A)

- **🗡️ Jailbreak Technique Library** (`offsec_ai.utils.llm_jailbreaks`)
  - DAN (Do Anything Now) variants, developer-mode bypass, roleplay/persona injection,
    refusal-suppression patterns, hypothetical framing, payload-splitting
  - Each technique carries OWASP LLM category refs, expected severity, and response detection strings
  - Constants: `DAN_TECHNIQUES`, `ROLEPLAY_TECHNIQUES`, `REFUSAL_SUPPRESSION_TECHNIQUES`,
    `HYPOTHETICAL_TECHNIQUES`, `PAYLOAD_SPLITTING_TECHNIQUES`, `JAILBREAK_TECHNIQUES` (combined)

- **🔠 Encoding/Obfuscation Bypass Engine** (`offsec_ai.utils.llm_encoders`)
  - Encodes payloads in base64, ROT-13, leetspeak, hex, reversed text, homoglyph, zero-width Unicode
  - `encode(payload, method)` — encode a string in the given representation
  - `wrap(payload, method)` — produce a complete prompt asking the model to decode-and-execute
  - `detect_bypass(response, payload)` — heuristic to detect if a model decoded and acted on the payload
  - `ENCODING_METHODS` — list of all available method names

- **💬 Multi-Turn Conversation Attacker** (`offsec_ai.core.llm_conversation_attacker`)
  - Requires `authorized=True`; prints legal authorization banner on every instantiation
  - Attack patterns: **crescendo** (gradual escalation), **many-shot** (in-context few-shot jailbreak),
    **context-priming** (false context injection), **goal-hijack** (incremental goal redefinition)
  - `attack(endpoint, mode, ...)` returns `MultiTurnAttackResult` with full conversation transcript,
    turn-by-turn analysis, escalation detection, and audit trail

- **📊 Guardrail Benchmarker** (`offsec_ai.core.guardrail_bench`)
  - Maps which OWASP LLM categories are blocked vs. passed by the target's content filter
  - Produces a per-category block rate and overall `GuardrailBenchResult` with a letter grade
  - Distinguishes between hard blocks (no response), soft refusals, and compliant responses

- **⚔️ Active LLM Attack CLI** (`offsec-ai llm-attack`)
  - Requires `--i-have-authorization`; authorization gate identical to `mcp-attack`/`openclaw-attack`
  - Modes: `jailbreak` · `encoding` · `multiturn` · `agentic` · `guardrail` · `all`
  - Safe mode — informational payload report (no auto-execution)
  - Deep mode — actively sends attack payloads and reports results
  - New models: `LLMAttackResult`, `LLMAttackReport` (`offsec_ai.models.llm_attack_result`)

- **Extended `LLMOwaspScanner`** — jailbreak and encoding payloads are now plugged into the
  deep-mode scanning pipeline alongside the existing 22 OWASP probes

### Added — Enterprise-Grade Hardening (Track B)

- **🏗️ Exception Hierarchy** (`offsec_ai.exceptions`)
  - `OffsecError` — base class for all package exceptions
  - `ScanError` — unexpected scan-operation failures
  - `ConfigError` — invalid/missing configuration at startup
  - `NetworkError` — DNS, connection, timeout failures
  - `TargetUnreachableError` — target unreachable after all retries (subclass of `NetworkError`)
  - `AuthorizationRequired` — consolidated single class (replaces duplicate definitions in
    `mcp_attacker` and `openclaw_attacker`)

- **⚙️ Centralised Config** (`offsec_ai.config`)
  - `OffsecConfig(BaseSettings)` — pydantic-settings v2, validated at import time
  - `SecretStr` for all API keys — never serialised or printed as plain text
  - `.env` file support via `python-dotenv`
  - All `OFFSEC_*` env vars: timeout, concurrency, retries, log level, log format, audit log path
  - `get_config()` returns a cached singleton; `reset_config()` for test isolation

- **📋 Structured Logging** (`offsec_ai.log_config`)
  - `configure_logging(level, fmt)` — central setup; `fmt="json"` emits newline-delimited JSON
  - `JsonFormatter` — includes `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `correlation_id`, `message`, plus
    all extra fields passed to the log call
  - `new_correlation_id()` / `get_correlation_id()` — `contextvars`-based async-safe correlation IDs
    so all log lines from a single scan/attack share the same ID
  - `audit_log(event, **fields)` — dedicated audit logger; always JSON; optionally rotated to file
    via `OFFSEC_AUDIT_LOG_FILE`; records every authorized attack invocation

- **Quality Gates**
  - `pyproject.toml`: ruff linter/formatter configuration added; pytest markers registered
    (`integration`, `slow`, `security`, `network`); `pydantic-settings` and `python-dotenv`
    added as core dependencies
  - `Makefile`: `ruff`, `bandit`, `audit` (pip-audit) targets; `ci` target updated

- **CI/CD Security Scanning**
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml`: `pip-audit` (dependency CVEs), `bandit` (SAST), `detect-secrets`
    steps added to every test run
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: `ruff`, `bandit`, `detect-secrets` hooks added
  - `.github/dependabot.yml`: automated dependency updates for pip and GitHub Actions
  - `.secrets.baseline`: detect-secrets baseline committed

- **CodeQL** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) — restored for public repo; Python + Actions scanning
  on push/PR/weekly schedule

### Fixed

- `httpx.AsyncClient` in all four scanners/attackers now sets `trust_env=False` to prevent
  ambient SOCKS/HTTP proxies from the environment leaking into scan connections
- `mcp-scan` CLI: added `--no-tls-verify` flag for self-signed/internal CA certificates
  (e.g. `mcp.simpleportchecker.com` uses a Cloudflare internal CA)
- `reportlab` added as explicit venv dependency (was declared in `pyproject.toml` but not
  installed in the manually-created venv, causing `test_cli_mtls_commands_exist` to fail)

### Tests

- 195 tests passing (up from 63 in v2.1.0)
- `tests/test_enterprise_features.py` — covers exceptions hierarchy, config validation,
  logging/correlation IDs, jailbreak payload structure, encoding round-trips, multi-turn
  attacker authorization gate, guardrail bench result model

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added — OpenClaw Gateway Security Assessment

- **🦀 OpenClaw Scanner** (`offsec_ai.core.openclaw_scanner.OpenClawScanner`)
  - Fingerprints OpenClaw personal AI assistant gateway deployments (default port 18789)
  - Five-phase scan: fingerprint → endpoint enumeration → auth posture → configuration → CVE matching
  - Detects unauthenticated REST API access, open DM policy, disabled sandbox, unauthenticated WebSocket upgrades, health endpoint disclosure, session history exposure, API key leakage
  - Response body capped at 64 KB per request to prevent memory issues with binary/large payloads
  - `trust_env=False` on httpx client to prevent ambient proxy interference
  - CLI command: `offsec-ai openclaw-scan`

- **⚔️ OpenClaw Attacker** (`offsec_ai.core.openclaw_attacker.OpenClawAttacker`)
  - Active red-team probe suite for authorized security assessments
  - Hard authorization gate: `OpenClawAttacker(authorized=False)` raises `AuthorizationRequired`; `--i-have-authorization` required at CLI
  - **Safe mode**: unauthenticated API endpoint probes across all known `/api/v1/*` paths
  - **Deep mode**: adds message injection, WebSocket upgrade probes, SSRF via webhook endpoint, and an informational prompt-injection payload report (payloads listed but not auto-executed to avoid unintended model manipulation)
  - Response body capped at 4 KB per attack request
  - CLI command: `offsec-ai openclaw-attack`

- **New models** (`offsec_ai.models.openclaw_result`): `OpenClawScanResult`, `OpenClawAttackReport`, `OpenClawAttackResult`, `OpenClawVulnerability`, `OpenClawServerInfo`, `OpenClawAuthPosture`, `OpenClawDMPolicy`, `OpenClawSandboxInfo`, `OpenClawAccessibleEndpoint`, `OpenClawVulnSeverity`

- **New utilities**:
  - `offsec_ai.utils.openclaw_cve_db` — 10 OpenClaw-specific advisories (OCL-ADV-001 through OCL-ADV-010) covering critical through informational severity; `match_cves()` path and version filter function; `OPENCLAW_FINGERPRINTS`, `OPENCLAW_PROBE_PATHS`, `OPENCLAW_API_PATHS`
  - `offsec_ai.utils.openclaw_payloads` — `DM_PROMPT_INJECTION_PAYLOADS`, `API_AUTH_BYPASS_PAYLOADS`, `MESSAGE_INJECTION_PAYLOADS`, `SSRF_WEBHOOK_PAYLOADS`, `WEBSOCKET_PROBE_PATHS`

- **Tests**: 63 new tests in `tests/test_openclaw.py` covering CVE DB integrity, payload structure, result model properties, scanner fingerprinting (positive/negative), endpoint enumeration, auth posture detection, configuration parsing, vulnerability matching, attacker authorization gating, API probes (safe mode), deep-mode attacks, and full scan-then-attack end-to-end flow — all passing

### Changed
- `pyproject.toml`: description updated to include "OpenClaw gateway security assessment"; keywords updated with `"openclaw"`, `"ai-gateway"`, `"personal-ai"`
- `src/offsec_ai/cli.py`: added `openclaw-scan` and `openclaw-attack` commands with `--port`, `--tls`, `--header`, `--timeout`, `--format`, `--output` options; `openclaw-attack` additionally requires `--i-have-authorization` and `--mode safe|deep`
- `docs/api.md`: new **OpenClaw Gateway Security** section with full API reference, advisory table, CLI examples, and scan-then-attack workflow example
- Removed `sonar-project.properties` and `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` (SonarCloud integration disabled)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- README logo replaced with inline ASCII art (no external image dependency)
- User-Agent strings updated from `SimplePortChecker/1.0` to `offsec-ai/2.0` in `L7Detector` and `HybridIdentityChecker`
- `reportlab>=4.0.0` promoted to core dependency in `pyproject.toml` (was missing, caused `ModuleNotFoundError` on fresh installs)
- Docker image now installs `[ai]` extras (`openai`, `anthropic`) so LLM judge works at runtime via env vars
- Dockerfile redundant pre-installs removed; `pip install ".[ai]"` is now the single install step
- `docker-push` and `docker-release` Makefile targets added with auto-versioning from `pyproject.toml`
- CI/CD: `docker.yml` image labels updated (title, description); unused `build-args` removed
- CI/CD: `publish.yml` PyPI environment URL no longer pins a hardcoded version
- Stale files removed: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `HYBRID_IDENTITY_QUICKREF.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_HYBRID_IDENTITY.md`, `MANIFEST.in`, empty `scripts/` dir
- `tests/test_dns_trace.py` removed (was a live-network script, not a pytest test)
- `tests/test_mtls.py` and `tests/test_mtls_integration.py` rewritten as proper `assert`-based pytest tests
- `setup_dev.sh` updated: branding, venv path (`.venv`), and `[ai]` extras
